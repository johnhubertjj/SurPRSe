# For the SNPsnap procedure: 
# Have a binary input: list of all SNPs that are in your input SNP list
# Run a linear model of your SNPs vs those which have similar properties:
# on the inverse, take those SNPs which have similar properties and sample without replacement for 10,000 sets based on p-values
