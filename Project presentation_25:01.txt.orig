Presentation for the 18th Jan

- Start with a description of the project
- method slide : PRS, (log regression with cov)

- N numbers of SNPs and genes for both datasets on all chromosomes
- N SNPs and N genes at each p-threshold
- Correlations between magma and pre -log10 gene based p-vals

-results (use ggplot to have them visible and nice to look at) but KEEP SIMPLE)

-have a presentation ready by tuesday morning!


- Check

-The p -130 was indeed an outlier, everyone in the candidate study had a score of 0 for 2 SNPs on 1 gene, one person had a very high genotype association to the SNP and therefore the profile was very significant because of the lack of data points to form a model.

- will need to refine: in future the Gene was 113730 : remove from analysis
