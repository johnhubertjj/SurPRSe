- MAGMA analysis

Flipping - look at the MAGMA function that describes taking the base pair positions as the start and as the end

Because you flipped the alleles e.g. if it is on positive strand A-T but on negative strand C-G then you convert them to A-T and flip because you can get them to the same strand (they have to be consistent)

This means that when it comes to selecting the regulatory regions +35 - 10kb, there won’t be any problem with selecting SNPs which are are not in that region 

(For our purposes it would not matter in any case)


- Antonio 

when he did the BGE, he has done no QC on the data, which is why there is a higher amount of SNPs 

If you filter by INFO scores and the PGCnoCLOZUK should have less SNPs

- look at the identifiers in each just to see what is available…

The LD pruned SNPs in PRS will be the same as MAGMA - so take from the first loop of the table for common genes.

- create a plink file for those SNPs only and test the number of SNPs and NPARAMs
