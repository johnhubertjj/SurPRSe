# What I did for Magma

- From the first analysis: took the SNPs within genes common to both PRS and MAGMA when doing a combined analysis
- limited the plink files down to clumped SNPs and to a P-value threshold -> FOR GENES.
- Ran the analysis through Magma, again limiting the annotation file to the SNPs common to the PGC thresholds -> for SNPs
- included covariates into the analysis
- printed out the NPARAMs in PRS and MAGMA


 did the same but straight from the clumped file without limiting to genes
 both exactly the same result
